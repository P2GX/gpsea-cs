  abstract        = {GLI3 mutations are known to be associated with nine syndromes/conditions in which polydactyly is a feature. In this review, the embryology, pathogenesis, and animal models of GLI3-related polydactyly are discussed first. This is followed by a detailed review of the genotype-phenotype correlations. Based on our review of the literature and our clinical experiences, we recommend viewing GLI3-related syndromes/conditions as four separate entities; each characterized by a specific pattern of polydactyly. These four entities are: the preaxial polydactyly type IV-Greig-acrocallosal spectrum, postaxial polydactyly types A/B, Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS), and oral-facial-digital overlap syndrome. We also provide illustrative clinical examples from our practice including a family with a novel GLI3 mutation causing PHS. The review also introduces the term 'Forme Fruste' preaxial polydactyly and gives several conclusions/recommendations including the recommendation to revise the current criteria for the clinical diagnosis of PHS.},

  abstract        = {Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a connective tissue disorder in which several systems are affected with great phenotypic variability. Although known to be associated with pathogenic variants in the FBN1 gene, few genotype-phenotype correlations have been found in proband studies only. In 1,575 consecutive MFS probands and relatives from the most comprehensive database worldwide, we established survival curves and sought genotype-phenotype correlations. A risk chart could be established with clinical and genetic data. Premature termination codon variants were not only associated with a shorter life expectancy and a high lifelong risk of aortic event, but also with the highest risk of severe scoliosis and a lower risk for ectopia lentis (EL) surgery. In-frame variants could be subdivided according to their impact on the cysteine content of fibrillin-1 with a global higher severity for cysteine loss variants and the highest frequency of EL surgery for cysteine addition variants. This study shows that FBN1 genotype-phenotype correlations exist for both aortic and extra-aortic features. It can be used for optimal risk stratification of patients with a great importance for genetic counseling and personalized medicine. This also provides additional data for the overall understanding of the role of fibrillin-1 in various organs.},

  abstract        = {Ikaros/IKZF1 is an essential transcription factor expressed throughout hematopoiesis. IKZF1 is implicated in lymphocyte and myeloid differentiation and negative regulation of cell proliferation. In humans, somatic mutations in IKZF1 have been linked to the development of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children and adults. Recently, heterozygous germline IKZF1 mutations have been identified in patients with a B cell immune deficiency mimicking common variable immunodeficiency. These mutations demonstrated incomplete penetrance and led to haploinsufficiency. Herein, we report 7 unrelated patients with a novel early-onset combined immunodeficiency associated with de novo germline IKZF1 heterozygous mutations affecting amino acid N159 located in the DNA-binding domain of IKZF1. Different bacterial and viral infections were diagnosed, but Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia was reported in all patients. One patient developed a T cell ALL. This immunodeficiency was characterized by innate and adaptive immune defects, including low numbers of B cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, and myeloid dendritic cells, as well as T cell and monocyte dysfunctions. Notably, most T cells exhibited a naive phenotype and were unable to evolve into effector memory cells. Functional studies indicated these mutations act as dominant negative. This defect expands the clinical spectrum of human IKZF1-associated diseases from somatic to germline, from haploinsufficient to dominant negative.},

Retrospective case series. Review of clinical notes, multimodal retinal imaging, and molecular diagnosis of 18 patients (17 families) with EOSRD/LCA and disease-causing variants in RPGRIP1. The mean age of visual symptoms onset was 0.87 ± 1 year (birth to 3 years), and the mean age at baseline visit was 11.4 ± 10.2 years (1-39 years). At the baseline visit, 44% of patients were legally blind (range, 2-39 years), and there was no significant association found between age and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in cross-sectional analysis. Retinal evaluation showed an abolished electroretinogram or a cone-rod dystrophy pattern, no or minimal pigment deposits, a hyperautofluorescent ring at the posterior pole, and a largely preserved central macular architecture, with retained outer nuclear layer and ellipsoid zone island into adulthood. Eleven variants (48%) were previously unreported, and 13 families (76%) had a double-null (DN) genotype. Twelve patients (67%) had follow-up assessments over a 15.7 ± 9.5-year period. The rate of BCVA decline was 0.02 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (1 letter)/year. RPGRIP1 EOSRD/LCA often presents at birth or early infancy, with nystagmus, decreased visual acuity, hyperopia, and photophobia. Patients with a DN genotype may develop symptoms earlier and have worse vision. Multimodal imaging may show a hyperautofluorescent posterior pole ring and relatively preserved central macular architecture, suggesting that the condition is a promising candidate for gene supplementation.},

  abstract        = {The phenotypic spectrum of GLI3 mutations includes autosomal dominant Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS) and Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS). PHS was first described as a lethal condition associating hypothalamic hamartoma, postaxial or central polydactyly, anal atresia and bifid epiglottis. Typical GCPS combines polysyndactyly of hands and feet and craniofacial features. Genotype-phenotype correlations have been found both for the location and the nature of GLI3 mutations, highlighting the bifunctional nature of GLI3 during development. Here we report on the molecular and clinical study of 76 cases from 55 families with either a GLI3 mutation (49 GCPS and 21 PHS), or a large deletion encompassing the GLI3 gene (6 GCPS cases). Most of mutations are novel and consistent with the previously reported genotype-phenotype correlation. Our results also show a correlation between the location of the mutation and abnormal corpus callosum observed in some patients with GCPS. Fetal PHS observations emphasize on the possible lethality of GLI3 mutations and extend the phenotypic spectrum of malformations such as agnathia and reductional limbs defects. GLI3 expression studied by in situ hybridization during human development confirms its early expression in target tissues.},

High-throughput genomic sequencing of a conservative estimate (24.2 Mb) of the disease locus on chromosome 9 using exon array capture identified independent mutations in TGFBR1 in three unrelated families. Subsequent dideoxy sequencing of TGFBR1 identified 11 distinct monoallelic mutations in 18 affected families, firmly establishing TGFBR1 as the causative gene. The nature of the sequence variants, which include mutations in the extracellular ligand-binding domain and a series of truncating mutations in the kinase domain, indicates a clear genotype-phenotype correlation between loss-of-function TGFBR1 mutations and MSSE. This distinguishes MSSE from the Marfan syndrome-related disorders in which missense mutations in TGFBR1 lead to developmental defects with vascular involvement but no reported predisposition to cancer.},

  abstract        = {Genetic FBN1 testing is pivotal for confirming the clinical diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. In an effort to evaluate variant causality, FBN1 databases are often used. We evaluated the current databases regarding FBN1 variants and validated associated phenotype records with a new Marfan syndrome geno-phenotyping tool called the Marfan score. We evaluated four databases (UMD-FBN1, ClinVar, the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD), and Uniprot) containing 2,250 FBN1 variants supported by 4,904 records presented in 307 references. The Marfan score calculated for phenotype data from the records quantified variant associations with Marfan syndrome phenotype. We calculated a Marfan score for 1,283 variants, of which we confirmed the database diagnosis of Marfan syndrome in 77.1%. This represented only 35.8% of the total registered variants; 18.5-33.3% (UMD-FBN1 versus HGMD) of variants associated with Marfan syndrome in the databases could not be confirmed by the recorded phenotype. FBN1 databases can be imprecise and incomplete. Data should be used with caution when evaluating FBN1 variants. At present, the UMD-FBN1 database seems to be the biggest and best curated; therefore, it is the most comprehensive database. However, the need for better genotype-phenotype curated databases is evident, and we hereby present such a database.Genet Med advance online publication 01 December 2016.},

  abstract        = {Isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency (ISOD) caused by sulfite oxidase gene (SUOX) mutations is a rare neurometabolic disease associated with ectopia lentis (EL). However, few genotype-phenotype correlations have been established yet. Potentially pathogenic SUOX mutations were screened from a Chinese cohort of congenital EL using panel-based next-generation sequencing and analyzed with multiple bioinformatics tools. The genotype-phenotype correlations were evaluated via a systematic review of SUOX mutations within our data and from the literature. A novel paternal missense mutation, c.205G &gt; C (p.A69P), and a recurrent maternal nonsense mutation, c.1200 C &gt; G (p.Y400*), of SUOX were identified in a 4-year-old boy from 312 probands. The biochemical assays manifested elevated urine sulfite and S-sulfocysteine accompanied by decreased homocysteine in the blood. The patient had bilateral EL and normal fundus, yet minimal neurological involvement and normal brain structure. Molecular modeling simulation revealed the p.A69P mutant had an unstable structure but an unchanged affinity for sulfite, while the truncated p.Y400* mutant showed decreased binding capacity. Genotype-phenotype analysis demonstrated patients with biallelic missense mutations had milder symptoms (P = 0.023), later age of onset (P &lt; 0.001), and a higher incidence of regression (P = 0.017) than other genotypes. No correlations were found regarding EL and other neurological symptoms. The data from this study not only enrich the known mutation spectrum of SUOX but also suggest that missense mutations are associated with mild and atypical symptoms.},

  abstract        = {Uromodulin-associated kidney disease (UAKD) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by uromodulin (UMOD) gene mutations. This study explored genotype-phenotype correlations by examining the relationship between the type of UMOD mutation and the age at onset of ESRD. Extensive bibliographic research was used to ascertain patient-level data of all patients with UAKD published up to October 2011. Data included sex; ages at onset of hyperuricemia, gout, and ESRD; and UMOD genotype. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models fitted with shared gamma frailty terms to adjust for within-family correlations were used to model time to event. Thirty-one peer-reviewed publications reporting on 202 patients from 74 families with 59 different UMOD mutations were included. Median ages at onset of hyperuricemia, gout, and ESRD were 24, 40, and 56 years, respectively. Men developed gout and ESRD significantly earlier than did women (age at ESRD was 50 years for men and 60 for women; P=0.04, shared frailty model). Median ages at ESRD development were lowest with Cys77Tyr (37.5 years) and highest with Gln316Pro (65.5 years) UMOD mutations. Onset of ESRD was significantly earlier with UMOD mutations located within the epidermal growth factor domains 2 and 3 (range, 45-52 years; P<0.01 and 0.04, respectively) compared with the cysteine-rich domains (range, 60-65 years; by shared frailty model). The UMOD genotype is related to the clinical phenotype of UAKD. This finding may assist in counseling of patients.},

  abstract        = {Polydactyly is a limb malformation and can occur as nonsyndromic polydactyly, syndromic polydactyly, or along with other limb defects. A few genes have been identified that cause various forms of syndromic and nonsyndromic polydactyly, of which GLI3 has been extensively explored. In the present study, GLI3 gene was screened by direct resequencing in 15 polydactyly cases with or without other anomalies. GLI3 screening revealed two novel pathogenic variants, NM_000168.6:c.3414delC [p.(H1138Qfs*68)] and NM_000168.6:c.1862C>T [p.(P621L)], found in two unrelated cases of familial complex pre- and postaxial polysyndactyly and sporadic Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS), respectively. The first pathogenic GLI3 variant, NM_000168.6:c.3414delC, causes premature protein truncation at the C-terminal domain of GLI3. Alternatively, the second pathogenic variant, NM_000168.6:c.1862C>T, lies in the DNA binding domain of GLI3 protein and may affect its hydrophobic interaction with DNA. Both pathogenic GLI3 variants had reduced transcriptional activity in HEK293 cells that likely had led to haploinsufficiency and, consequently, the clinical phenotypes. Overall, the present study reports a novel familial case of complex pre- and postaxial polysyndactyly and the underlying novel pathogenic GLI3 variant expanding the clinical criteria for GLI3 mutational spectrum to complex pre- and postaxial polysyndactyly. Furthermore, this study also reports a novel GLI3 pathogenic variant linked to GCPS, highlighting the known genotype-phenotype correlation.},

  abstract        = {In a single-center renal clinic, we have established routine mutation testing to diagnose UMOD-associated kidney disease (UAKD), an autosomal dominant disorder typically characterized by gout, hyperuricemia, and renal failure in the third to sixth decades. Four probands and their multigeneration kindreds were assessed by clinical, historical, and biochemical means. Diagnostic UMOD sequencing was performed, and mutant uromodulin was characterized in vitro. All available affected members of the four kindreds harbored the same complex indel change in UMOD, which was associated with almost complete absence of gout and a later onset of CKD; the youngest age at ESRD or death was 38 years (range, 38 to 68 years) compared with 3 to 70 years in other reports. Three mutation carriers (all ≤35 years) are currently asymptomatic. The indel sequence (c.278_289del TCTGCCCCGAAGinsCCGCCTCCT; p.V93_G97del/ins AASC) results in the replacement of five amino acids, including one cysteine, by four novel residues, also including a cysteine. Uromodulin staining of the only available patient biopsy suggested disorganized intracellular trafficking with cellular accumulation. Functional characterization of the mutant isoform revealed retarded intracellular trafficking associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention and reduced secretion into cell culture media, but to a lesser extent than we observed with the previously reported C150S mutation. The indel mutation is associated with a relatively mild clinical UAKD phenotype, consistent with our in vitro analysis. UAKD should be routinely considered as a causative gene for ESRD of unknown cause, especially where there is an associated family history or where biopsy reveals interstitial fibrosis.},

  abstract        = {Several monogenic causes of familial myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) have recently been identified. We studied 2 families with cytopenia, predisposition to MDS with chromosome 7 aberrations, immunodeficiency, and progressive cerebellar dysfunction. Genetic studies uncovered heterozygous missense mutations in SAMD9L , a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome arm 7q. Consistent with a gain-of-function effect, ectopic expression of the 2 identified SAMD9L mutants decreased cell proliferation relative to wild-type protein. Of the 10 individuals identified who were heterozygous for either SAMD9L mutation, 3 developed MDS upon loss of the mutated SAMD9L allele following intracellular infections associated with myeloid, B-, and natural killer (NK)-cell deficiency. Five other individuals, 3 with spontaneously resolved cytopenic episodes in infancy, harbored hematopoietic revertant mosaicism by uniparental disomy of 7q, with loss of the mutated allele or additional in cis SAMD9L truncating mutations. Examination of 1 individual indicated that somatic reversions were postnatally selected. Somatic mutations were tracked to CD34 (+)hematopoietic progenitor cell populations, being further enriched in B and NK cells. Stimulation of these cell types with interferon (IFN)-α or IFN-γ induced SAMD9L expression. Clinically, revertant mosaicism was associated with milder disease, yet neurological manifestations persisted in 3 individuals. Two carriers also harbored a rare, in trans germ line SAMD9L missense loss-of-function variant, potentially counteracting the SAMD9L mutation. Our results demonstrate that gain-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor SAMD9L cause cytopenia, immunodeficiency, variable neurological presentation, and predisposition to MDS with -7/del(7q), whereas hematopoietic revertant mosaicism commonly ameliorated clinical manifestations. The findings suggest a role for SAMD9L in regulating IFN-driven, demand-adapted hematopoiesis.},

In 26 children with isolated COX deficiency, we studied mutations in the SCO2 gene, which is involved in the copper transport into the inner mitochondrial membrane, and we analysed the clinical and biochemical consequences of SCO2 mutations. The activities of respiratory chain complexes were measured spectrophotometrically in isolated mitochondria and/or crude cell extracts in all available tissues. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) was used to separate the complexes and their subunits. The mutations were detected by sequencing and RFLP analysis. Mutations in the SCO2 gene were found in six children. Early neonatal onset of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and encephalopathy were observed in one boy with compound heterozygous mutations C1280T and G1541A. In all five children with homozygous mutation G1541A, progressive encephalopathy developed between 2 and 6 mo of age. Isolated COX deficiency was found in the skeletal muscle, heart, liver and brain but not in fibroblasts. 2D-PAGE in the skeletal muscle showed markedly decreased amounts of all COX subunits. Our results suggest that mutations in the SCO2 gene are not rare, at least in our population. Although clinical symptoms may rely on the type of SCO2 mutation, the prognosis is unfavourable in all patients.},

Here, a Chinese 21OHD cohort was enrolled to investigate the clinical, biochemical, and genetic characteristics of this disorder. Mutation analysis of CYP21A2 gene, 21-hydroxylase activity assays and in silico predictions of protein structure were performed. Genotype-phenotype associations were analyzed in both the cohort and 487 Chinese CAH patients ever reported. Among the total cohort (72 patients), 47 patients (65.3%) were diagnosed as salt-wasting (SW) phenotype, 11 (15.3%) were simple virilizing (SV) type, and 14 (19.4%) were nonclassic (NC) type. The value of FSH and LH for prediction of the SW phenotype was up to 0.862 and 0.669, respectively. Overall, the detection rate of CYP21A2 mutation was 97.9%, which revealed 25 mutations and 36 genotypes. Four novel mutations (p.L199X, p.E321del, p.H393Q, and p.L459-P464del) were detected and induced a significantly reduced 21-hydroxylase activity. Generally, disease severity can be predicted with the genotypes. The most common genotypes in Chinese population were I2G/I2G (12.5%), I2G/Large lesion (12.1%), I173N/I2G (10.3%), and I173N/Large lesion (9.2%). The SW form of CAH is prominent in deletion or intronic splice mutations, namely I2G/I2G (18.6%), I2G/Large lesion (17.2%) and Large lesion/Large lesion (8.6%). Four novel mutations were identified and a high consistency of genotype-phenotype association was found in SW CAH. Moreover, FSH and LH levels were proved to be a promising marker for predicting the severity of the disease.},
