  abstract        = {Several monogenic causes of familial myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) have recently been identified. We studied 2 families with cytopenia, predisposition to MDS with chromosome 7 aberrations, immunodeficiency, and progressive cerebellar dysfunction. Genetic studies uncovered heterozygous missense mutations in SAMD9L , a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome arm 7q. Consistent with a gain-of-function effect, ectopic expression of the 2 identified SAMD9L mutants decreased cell proliferation relative to wild-type protein. Of the 10 individuals identified who were heterozygous for either SAMD9L mutation, 3 developed MDS upon loss of the mutated SAMD9L allele following intracellular infections associated with myeloid, B-, and natural killer (NK)-cell deficiency. Five other individuals, 3 with spontaneously resolved cytopenic episodes in infancy, harbored hematopoietic revertant mosaicism by uniparental disomy of 7q, with loss of the mutated allele or additional in cis SAMD9L truncating mutations. Examination of 1 individual indicated that somatic reversions were postnatally selected. Somatic mutations were tracked to CD34 (+)hematopoietic progenitor cell populations, being further enriched in B and NK cells. Stimulation of these cell types with interferon (IFN)-α or IFN-γ induced SAMD9L expression. Clinically, revertant mosaicism was associated with milder disease, yet neurological manifestations persisted in 3 individuals. Two carriers also harbored a rare, in trans germ line SAMD9L missense loss-of-function variant, potentially counteracting the SAMD9L mutation. Our results demonstrate that gain-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor SAMD9L cause cytopenia, immunodeficiency, variable neurological presentation, and predisposition to MDS with -7/del(7q), whereas hematopoietic revertant mosaicism commonly ameliorated clinical manifestations. The findings suggest a role for SAMD9L in regulating IFN-driven, demand-adapted hematopoiesis.},

  abstract        = {Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency represents a heterogeneous group of disorders. Numerous proteins are required for efficient COX assembly and maintenance. In 26 children with isolated COX deficiency, we studied mutations in the SCO2 gene, which is involved in the copper transport into the inner mitochondrial membrane, and we analysed the clinical and biochemical consequences of SCO2 mutations. The activities of respiratory chain complexes were measured spectrophotometrically in isolated mitochondria and/or crude cell extracts in all available tissues. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) was used to separate the complexes and their subunits. The mutations were detected by sequencing and RFLP analysis. Mutations in the SCO2 gene were found in six children. Early neonatal onset of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and encephalopathy were observed in one boy with compound heterozygous mutations C1280T and G1541A. In all five children with homozygous mutation G1541A, progressive encephalopathy developed between 2 and 6 mo of age. Isolated COX deficiency was found in the skeletal muscle, heart, liver and brain but not in fibroblasts. 2D-PAGE in the skeletal muscle showed markedly decreased amounts of all COX subunits. Our results suggest that mutations in the SCO2 gene are not rare, at least in our population. Although clinical symptoms may rely on the type of SCO2 mutation, the prognosis is unfavourable in all patients.},
