  abstract     = {MPV17 -related mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) maintenance defect presents in the vast majority of affected individuals as an early-onset encephalohepatopathic (hepatocerebral) disease that is typically associated with mtDNA depletion, particularly in the liver. A later-onset neuromyopathic disease characterized by myopathy and neuropathy, and associated with multiple mtDNA deletions in muscle, has also rarely been described. MPV17 -related mtDNA maintenance defect, encephalohepatopathic form is characterized by: Hepatic manifestations (liver dysfunction that typically progresses to liver failure, cholestasis, hepatomegaly, and steatosis); Neurologic involvement (developmental delay, hypotonia, microcephaly, and motor and sensory peripheral neuropathy); Gastrointestinal manifestations (gastrointestinal dysmotility, feeding difficulties, and failure to thrive); and Metabolic derangements (lactic acidosis and hypoglycemia). Less frequent manifestations include renal tubulopathy, nephrocalcinosis, and hypoparathyroidism. Progressive liver disease often leads to death in infancy or early childhood. Hepatocellular carcinoma has been reported. The diagnosis of MPV17 -related mtDNA maintenance defect is established in a proband by the identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in MPV17 by molecular genetic testing. Treatment of manifestations: Ideally management is by a multidisciplinary team including specialists in hepatology, neurology, nutrition, clinical genetics, and child development. Nutritional support should be provided by a dietitian experienced in managing children with liver diseases; prevention of hypoglycemia requires frequent feeds and uncooked cornstarch (1-2 g/kg/dose). Although liver transplantation remains the only treatment option for liver failure, it is controversial because of the multisystem involvement in this disorder. Prevention of secondary complications: Prevent nutritional deficiencies (e.g., of fat-soluble vitamins) by ensuring adequate intake. Surveillance: Monitor: Liver function to assess progression of liver disease; Serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) concentration and hepatic ultrasound examination for evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma; Development, neurologic status, and nutritional status. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Prolonged fasting. MPV17 -related mtDNA maintenance defect is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk are possible if the pathogenic variants in the family are known.},

In this review, the embryology, pathogenesis, and animal models of GLI3-related polydactyly are discussed first. This is followed by a detailed review of the genotype-phenotype correlations. Based on our review of the literature and our clinical experiences, we recommend viewing GLI3-related syndromes/conditions as four separate entities; each characterized by a specific pattern of polydactyly. These four entities are: the preaxial polydactyly type IV-Greig-acrocallosal spectrum, postaxial polydactyly types A/B, Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS), and oral-facial-digital overlap syndrome. We also provide illustrative clinical examples from our practice including a family with a novel GLI3 mutation causing PHS. The review also introduces the term 'Forme Fruste' preaxial polydactyly and gives several conclusions/recommendations including the recommendation to revise the current criteria for the clinical diagnosis of PHS.},

  abstract        = {Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a connective tissue disorder in which several systems are affected with great phenotypic variability. Although known to be associated with pathogenic variants in the FBN1 gene, few genotype-phenotype correlations have been found in proband studies only. In 1,575 consecutive MFS probands and relatives from the most comprehensive database worldwide, we established survival curves and sought genotype-phenotype correlations. A risk chart could be established with clinical and genetic data. Premature termination codon variants were not only associated with a shorter life expectancy and a high lifelong risk of aortic event, but also with the highest risk of severe scoliosis and a lower risk for ectopia lentis (EL) surgery. In-frame variants could be subdivided according to their impact on the cysteine content of fibrillin-1 with a global higher severity for cysteine loss variants and the highest frequency of EL surgery for cysteine addition variants. This study shows that FBN1 genotype-phenotype correlations exist for both aortic and extra-aortic features. It can be used for optimal risk stratification of patients with a great importance for genetic counseling and personalized medicine. This also provides additional data for the overall understanding of the role of fibrillin-1 in various organs.},

  abstract        = {Ikaros/IKZF1 is an essential transcription factor expressed throughout hematopoiesis. IKZF1 is implicated in lymphocyte and myeloid differentiation and negative regulation of cell proliferation. In humans, somatic mutations in IKZF1 have been linked to the development of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children and adults. Recently, heterozygous germline IKZF1 mutations have been identified in patients with a B cell immune deficiency mimicking common variable immunodeficiency. These mutations demonstrated incomplete penetrance and led to haploinsufficiency. Herein, we report 7 unrelated patients with a novel early-onset combined immunodeficiency associated with de novo germline IKZF1 heterozygous mutations affecting amino acid N159 located in the DNA-binding domain of IKZF1. Different bacterial and viral infections were diagnosed, but Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia was reported in all patients. One patient developed a T cell ALL. This immunodeficiency was characterized by innate and adaptive immune defects, including low numbers of B cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, and myeloid dendritic cells, as well as T cell and monocyte dysfunctions. Notably, most T cells exhibited a naive phenotype and were unable to evolve into effector memory cells. Functional studies indicated these mutations act as dominant negative. This defect expands the clinical spectrum of human IKZF1-associated diseases from somatic to germline, from haploinsufficient to dominant negative.},

We tested whether LMNA mutation DNA location and mutation subtype can predict phenotype severity in patients with lamin heart disease. We used a semantic workflow platform and manual electronic literature search to identify published LMNA mutations with cardiac-predominant phenotype. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) assembled lamin heart disease into classes based on phenotype severity. 176 reported causative mutations were classified and any relationships to mutation location/subtype assessed by contingency analysis. More adverse phenotype was associated with mutation location upstream of the NLS (p=0.014, OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.19 to 4.80) but not with non-missense mutations (p=0.337, OR 1.36, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.57), although an association with non-missense mutations was identified in a subcluster with malignant ventricular arrhythmia (p=0.005, OR 2.64, 95% CI 0.76 to 9.21). HCA limited to the 65 mutations described on ClinVar as pathogenic/likely pathogenic showed similar findings (upstream of NLS, p=0.030, OR 4.78, 95% CI 1.28 to 17.83; non-missense, p=0.121, OR 2.64, 95% CI 0.76 to 9.21) as did analysis limited to pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics standards. Cardiac patients with an LMNA mutation located upstream versus downstream of the NLS have a more adverse cardiac phenotype, and some missense mutations can be as harmful as non-missense ones.},

Retrospective case series. Review of clinical notes, multimodal retinal imaging, and molecular diagnosis of 18 patients (17 families) with EOSRD/LCA and disease-causing variants in RPGRIP1. The mean age of visual symptoms onset was 0.87 ± 1 year (birth to 3 years), and the mean age at baseline visit was 11.4 ± 10.2 years (1-39 years). At the baseline visit, 44% of patients were legally blind (range, 2-39 years), and there was no significant association found between age and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in cross-sectional analysis. Retinal evaluation showed an abolished electroretinogram or a cone-rod dystrophy pattern, no or minimal pigment deposits, a hyperautofluorescent ring at the posterior pole, and a largely preserved central macular architecture, with retained outer nuclear layer and ellipsoid zone island into adulthood. Eleven variants (48%) were previously unreported, and 13 families (76%) had a double-null (DN) genotype. Twelve patients (67%) had follow-up assessments over a 15.7 ± 9.5-year period. The rate of BCVA decline was 0.02 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (1 letter)/year. RPGRIP1 EOSRD/LCA often presents at birth or early infancy, with nystagmus, decreased visual acuity, hyperopia, and photophobia. Patients with a DN genotype may develop symptoms earlier and have worse vision. Multimodal imaging may show a hyperautofluorescent posterior pole ring and relatively preserved central macular architecture, suggesting that the condition is a promising candidate for gene supplementation.},

  abstract        = {The phenotypic spectrum of GLI3 mutations includes autosomal dominant Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS) and Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS). PHS was first described as a lethal condition associating hypothalamic hamartoma, postaxial or central polydactyly, anal atresia and bifid epiglottis. Typical GCPS combines polysyndactyly of hands and feet and craniofacial features. Genotype-phenotype correlations have been found both for the location and the nature of GLI3 mutations, highlighting the bifunctional nature of GLI3 during development. Here we report on the molecular and clinical study of 76 cases from 55 families with either a GLI3 mutation (49 GCPS and 21 PHS), or a large deletion encompassing the GLI3 gene (6 GCPS cases). Most of mutations are novel and consistent with the previously reported genotype-phenotype correlation. Our results also show a correlation between the location of the mutation and abnormal corpus callosum observed in some patients with GCPS. Fetal PHS observations emphasize on the possible lethality of GLI3 mutations and extend the phenotypic spectrum of malformations such as agnathia and reductional limbs defects. GLI3 expression studied by in situ hybridization during human development confirms its early expression in target tissues.},

  abstract        = {The variant spectrum and the phenotype of X-linked Kabuki syndrome type 2 (KS2) are poorly understood. Genetic and clinical details of new and published individuals with pathogenic KDM6A variants were compiled and analyzed. Sixty-one distinct pathogenic KDM6A variants (50 truncating, 11 missense) from 80 patients (34 males, 46 females) were identified. Missense variants clustered in the TRP 2, 3, 7 and Jmj-C domains. Truncating variants were significantly more likely to be de novo. Thirteen individuals had maternally inherited variants and one had a paternally inherited variant. Neonatal feeding difficulties, hypoglycemia, postnatal growth retardation, poor weight gain, motor delay, intellectual disability (ID), microcephaly, congenital heart anomalies, palate defects, renal malformations, strabismus, hearing loss, recurrent infections, hyperinsulinism, seizures, joint hypermobility, and gastroesophageal reflux were frequent clinical findings. Facial features of over a third of patients were not typical for KS. Males were significantly more likely to be born prematurely, have shorter stature, and severe developmental delay/ID. We expand the KDM6A variant spectrum and delineate the KS2 phenotype. We demonstrate that the variability of the KS2 phenotypic depends on sex and the variant type. We also highlight the overlaps and differences between the phenotypes of KS2 and KS1.},

  abstract        = {Genetic FBN1 testing is pivotal for confirming the clinical diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. In an effort to evaluate variant causality, FBN1 databases are often used. We evaluated the current databases regarding FBN1 variants and validated associated phenotype records with a new Marfan syndrome geno-phenotyping tool called the Marfan score. We evaluated four databases (UMD-FBN1, ClinVar, the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD), and Uniprot) containing 2,250 FBN1 variants supported by 4,904 records presented in 307 references. The Marfan score calculated for phenotype data from the records quantified variant associations with Marfan syndrome phenotype. We calculated a Marfan score for 1,283 variants, of which we confirmed the database diagnosis of Marfan syndrome in 77.1%. This represented only 35.8% of the total registered variants; 18.5-33.3% (UMD-FBN1 versus HGMD) of variants associated with Marfan syndrome in the databases could not be confirmed by the recorded phenotype. FBN1 databases can be imprecise and incomplete. Data should be used with caution when evaluating FBN1 variants. At present, the UMD-FBN1 database seems to be the biggest and best curated; therefore, it is the most comprehensive database. However, the need for better genotype-phenotype curated databases is evident, and we hereby present such a database.Genet Med advance online publication 01 December 2016.},

  abstract        = {Biallelic pathogenic variants in neuroblastoma-amplified sequence (NBAS) cause a pleiotropic multisystem disorder. Three clinical subgroups have been defined correlating with the localisation of pathogenic variants in the NBAS gene: variants affecting the C-terminal region of NBAS result in SOPH syndrome (short stature, optic atrophy, Pelger-Huët anomaly), variants affecting the Sec 39 domain are associated with infantile liver failure syndrome type 2 (ILFS2) and variants affecting the ß-propeller domain give rise to a combined phenotype. However, there is still unexplained phenotypic diversity across the three subgroups, challenging the current concept of genotype-phenotype correlations in NBAS-associated disease. Therefore, besides examining the genetic influence, we aim to elucidate the potential impact of pre-symptomatic diagnosis, emergency management and other modifying variables on the clinical phenotype. We investigated genotype-phenotype correlations in individuals sharing the same genotypes (n = 30 individuals), and in those sharing the same missense variants with a loss-of-function variant in trans (n = 38 individuals). Effects of a pre-symptomatic diagnosis and emergency management on the severity of acute liver failure (ALF) episodes also were analysed, comparing liver function tests (ALAT, ASAT, INR) and mortality. A strong genotype-phenotype correlation was demonstrated in individuals sharing the same genotype; this was especially true for the ILFS2 subgroup. Genotype-phenotype correlation in patients sharing only one missense variant was still high, though at a lower level. Pre-symptomatic diagnosis in combination with an emergency management protocol leads to a trend of reduced severity of ALF. High genetic impact on clinical phenotype in NBAS-associated disease facilitates monitoring and management of affected patients sharing the same genotype. Pre-symptomatic diagnosis and an emergency management protocol do not prevent ALF but may reduce its clinical severity.},

  abstract        = {Homozygous mutations in WWOX were reported in eight individuals of two families with autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 and in two siblings with infantile epileptic encephalopathy (IEE), including one who deceased prior to DNA sampling. By combining array comparative genomic hybridisation, targeted Sanger sequencing and next generation sequencing, we identified five further patients from four families with IEE due to biallelic alterations of WWOX. We identified eight deleterious WWOX alleles consisting in four deletions, a four base-pair frameshifting deletion, one missense and two nonsense mutations. Genotype-phenotype correlation emerges from the seven reported families. The phenotype in four patients carrying two predicted null alleles was characterised by (1) little if any psychomotor acquisitions, poor spontaneous motility and absent eye contact from birth, (2) pharmacoresistant epilepsy starting in the 1st weeks of life, (3) possible retinal degeneration, acquired microcephaly and premature death. This contrasted with the less severe autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 phenotype due to hypomorphic alleles. In line with this correlation, the phenotype in two siblings carrying a null allele and a missense mutation was intermediate. Our results obtained by a combination of different molecular techniques undoubtedly incriminate WWOX as a gene for recessive IEE and illustrate the usefulness of high throughput data mining for the identification of genes for rare autosomal recessive disorders. The structure of the WWOX locus encompassing the FRA16D fragile site might explain why constitutive deletions are recurrently reported in genetic databases, suggesting that WWOX-related encephalopathies, although likely rare, may not be exceptional.},

  abstract        = {Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most frequent genetic disorders, affecting 1:3,000 worldwide. Identification of genotype-phenotype correlations is challenging because of the wide range clinical variability, the progressive nature of the disorder, and extreme diversity of the mutational spectrum. We report 136 individuals with a distinct phenotype carrying one of five different NF1 missense mutations affecting p.Arg1809. Patients presented with multiple café-au-lait macules (CALM) with or without freckling and Lisch nodules, but no externally visible plexiform neurofibromas or clear cutaneous neurofibromas were found. About 25% of the individuals had Noonan-like features. Pulmonic stenosis and short stature were significantly more prevalent compared with classic cohorts (P < 0.0001). Developmental delays and/or learning disabilities were reported in over 50% of patients. Melanocytes cultured from a CALM in a segmental NF1-patient showed two different somatic NF1 mutations, p.Arg1809Cys and a multi-exon deletion, providing genetic evidence that p.Arg1809Cys is a loss-of-function mutation in the melanocytes and causes a pigmentary phenotype. Constitutional missense mutations at p.Arg1809 affect 1.23% of unrelated NF1 probands in the UAB cohort, therefore this specific NF1 genotype-phenotype correlation will affect counseling and management of a significant number of patients.},

  abstract        = {Several monogenic causes of familial myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) have recently been identified. We studied 2 families with cytopenia, predisposition to MDS with chromosome 7 aberrations, immunodeficiency, and progressive cerebellar dysfunction. Genetic studies uncovered heterozygous missense mutations in SAMD9L , a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome arm 7q. Consistent with a gain-of-function effect, ectopic expression of the 2 identified SAMD9L mutants decreased cell proliferation relative to wild-type protein. Of the 10 individuals identified who were heterozygous for either SAMD9L mutation, 3 developed MDS upon loss of the mutated SAMD9L allele following intracellular infections associated with myeloid, B-, and natural killer (NK)-cell deficiency. Five other individuals, 3 with spontaneously resolved cytopenic episodes in infancy, harbored hematopoietic revertant mosaicism by uniparental disomy of 7q, with loss of the mutated allele or additional in cis SAMD9L truncating mutations. Examination of 1 individual indicated that somatic reversions were postnatally selected. Somatic mutations were tracked to CD34 (+)hematopoietic progenitor cell populations, being further enriched in B and NK cells. Stimulation of these cell types with interferon (IFN)-α or IFN-γ induced SAMD9L expression. Clinically, revertant mosaicism was associated with milder disease, yet neurological manifestations persisted in 3 individuals. Two carriers also harbored a rare, in trans germ line SAMD9L missense loss-of-function variant, potentially counteracting the SAMD9L mutation. Our results demonstrate that gain-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor SAMD9L cause cytopenia, immunodeficiency, variable neurological presentation, and predisposition to MDS with -7/del(7q), whereas hematopoietic revertant mosaicism commonly ameliorated clinical manifestations. The findings suggest a role for SAMD9L in regulating IFN-driven, demand-adapted hematopoiesis.},

His older sister who died at the age of 22 months from an EOEE was also homozygous for the copy number variations in 16q23.1. This deletion includes the first six exons of WWOX and results in a null genotype in homozygous patients. This family gives additional support for the implication of WWOX in severe EOEEs. We report for the first time prenatal ultrasound findings in a fetus with a WWOX-null genotype. Our study expands the range of brain abnormalities in WWOX-related EOEEs. This additional family confirms the genotype-phenotype correlation with WWOX-null alleles associated with the most severe form of WWOX-related epileptic encephalopathy with premature death.},

  abstract        = {Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency represents a heterogeneous group of disorders. Numerous proteins are required for efficient COX assembly and maintenance. In 26 children with isolated COX deficiency, we studied mutations in the SCO2 gene, which is involved in the copper transport into the inner mitochondrial membrane, and we analysed the clinical and biochemical consequences of SCO2 mutations. The activities of respiratory chain complexes were measured spectrophotometrically in isolated mitochondria and/or crude cell extracts in all available tissues. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) was used to separate the complexes and their subunits. The mutations were detected by sequencing and RFLP analysis. Mutations in the SCO2 gene were found in six children. Early neonatal onset of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and encephalopathy were observed in one boy with compound heterozygous mutations C1280T and G1541A. In all five children with homozygous mutation G1541A, progressive encephalopathy developed between 2 and 6 mo of age. Isolated COX deficiency was found in the skeletal muscle, heart, liver and brain but not in fibroblasts. 2D-PAGE in the skeletal muscle showed markedly decreased amounts of all COX subunits. Our results suggest that mutations in the SCO2 gene are not rare, at least in our population. Although clinical symptoms may rely on the type of SCO2 mutation, the prognosis is unfavourable in all patients.},

  abstract        = {Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a monogenic disorder leading to special facial features, mental retardation, and multiple system malformations. Lysine demethylase 6A, (KDM6A, MIM*300128) is the pathogenic gene of Kabuki syndrome type 2 (KS2, MIM#300867), which accounts for only 5%-8% of KS. Previous studies suggested that female patients with KS2 may have a milder phenotype. We summarized the phenotype and genotype of KS2 patients who were diagnosed in Shanghai Children's Medical Center since July 2017 and conducted a 1:3 matched case-control study according to age and sex to investigate sex-specific differences between patients with and without KS2. There were 12 KS2 cases in this study, and 8 of them matched with 24 controls. The intelligence quotient (IQ) score of the case group was significantly lower than that of the control group (P < 0.001). In addition, both the incidence of intellectual disability (ID) (IQ < 70) and moderate-to-severe ID (IQ < 55) were significantly higher in the case group than those in the control group. No sex-specific difference was found in the incidence of ID or moderate-to-severe ID between the female cases and female controls, whereas there was a significant difference between male cases and male controls. Furthermore, the rate of moderate-to-severe ID and congenital heart disease (CHD) was significantly higher in the male group than that in the female group. Our results showed that a sex-specific difference was exhibited in the clinical phenotypes of KS2 patients. The incidence of CHD was higher in male patients, and mental retardation was significantly impaired. However, the female patients' phenotype was mild.},

  abstract        = {Steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD) is the most common enzymatic defect, but the genotype-phenotype associations have not been well established in Chinese patients. Here, a Chinese 21OHD cohort was enrolled to investigate the clinical, biochemical, and genetic characteristics of this disorder. Mutation analysis of CYP21A2 gene, 21-hydroxylase activity assays and in silico predictions of protein structure were performed. Genotype-phenotype associations were analyzed in both the cohort and 487 Chinese CAH patients ever reported. Among the total cohort (72 patients), 47 patients (65.3%) were diagnosed as salt-wasting (SW) phenotype, 11 (15.3%) were simple virilizing (SV) type, and 14 (19.4%) were nonclassic (NC) type. The value of FSH and LH for prediction of the SW phenotype was up to 0.862 and 0.669, respectively. Overall, the detection rate of CYP21A2 mutation was 97.9%, which revealed 25 mutations and 36 genotypes. Four novel mutations (p.L199X, p.E321del, p.H393Q, and p.L459-P464del) were detected and induced a significantly reduced 21-hydroxylase activity. Generally, disease severity can be predicted with the genotypes. The most common genotypes in Chinese population were I2G/I2G (12.5%), I2G/Large lesion (12.1%), I173N/I2G (10.3%), and I173N/Large lesion (9.2%). The SW form of CAH is prominent in deletion or intronic splice mutations, namely I2G/I2G (18.6%), I2G/Large lesion (17.2%) and Large lesion/Large lesion (8.6%). Four novel mutations were identified and a high consistency of genotype-phenotype association was found in SW CAH. Moreover, FSH and LH levels were proved to be a promising marker for predicting the severity of the disease.},
