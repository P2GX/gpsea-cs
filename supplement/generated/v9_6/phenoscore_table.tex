\caption{Mann-Whitney U tests performed using GPSEA to assess association between a genotype and a phenotype score.
    1/1: biallelic with reference to the indicate variant; 
    0/1: heterozygous with reference to the indicated variant; 0/0: Neither allele has the indicated variant.
    Citations in the xrefs column show previous publications that have presented similar findings.}
