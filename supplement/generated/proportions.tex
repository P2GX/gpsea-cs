\caption{\textbf{Significant HPO terms according to organ system}. Distribution of significant Fisher exact test results according to top-level HPO term. We performed an exact multinomial test to test the null hypothesis that null hypothesis that the observed counts in each top-level HPO term (organ system) follow the proportions that one would expect from the total number of descendent terms of the top-level terms. We obtained a p value of $3.10\times 10^{-31}$, which allows us to accept the alternative hypothesis that at least one of the observed proportions differs from its expected value. The largest differences were observed for \texttt{Abnormality of the nervous system} (expected 10.8\%, observed 24.7\%), \texttt{Abnormality of metabolism/homeostasis} (expected 9.5\%, observed 1.3\%, and \texttt{Neoplasm} (expected 2.8\%, observed 7.1\%).}
