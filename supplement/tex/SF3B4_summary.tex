\caption{The cohort comprised 26 individuals (18 females, 8 males). A total of 41 HPO terms were used to annotate the cohort. Disease diagnosis: Acrofacial dysostosis 1, Nager type (OMIM:154400). 
In one published analysis, it was stated that ``although no significant genotypeâ€“phenotype association was found, it is notable that patients with frameshift SF3B4 variants and predicted to lead to nonsense-mediated RNA 
decay (NMD) of the transcripts tended to have a more severe clinical manifestation''. The authors did not correct for multiple testing and did not find nominally significant associations \cite{PMID_35331022}.
No significant correlation found in our study. A total of 26 unique variant alleles were found in \textit{SF3B4} (transcript: \texttt{NM\_005850.5}, protein id: \texttt{NP\_005841.1}).}
