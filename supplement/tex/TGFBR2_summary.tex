\caption{The cohort comprised 53 individuals (23 females, 30 males). 4 of these individuals were reported to be deceased. A total of 96 HPO terms were used to annotate the cohort. Disease diagnosis: Loeys-Dietz syndrome 2 (OMIM:610168). No statistically significant results identified. A total of 53 unique variant alleles were found in \textit{TGFBR2} (transcript: \texttt{NM\_003242.6}, protein id: \texttt{NP\_003233.4}).}
