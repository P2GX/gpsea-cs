\caption{ The cohort comprised 419 individuals (192 females, 169 males, 58 with unknown sex). A total of 36 HPO terms were used to annotate the cohort. Disease diagnosis: Neurofibromatosis, type 1 (OMIM:162200). A substantial body of literature exists about genotype-phenotype correlations. The correlations described in this notebook
have been previously reported \cite{PMID_26178382,PMID_17160901,PMID_20513137}.
 A total of 36 unique variant alleles were found in \textit{NF1} (transcript: \texttt{NM\_001042492.3}, protein id: \texttt{NP\_001035957.1}).}
