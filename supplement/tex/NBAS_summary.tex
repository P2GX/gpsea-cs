\caption{ The cohort comprised 67 individuals (19 females, 21 males, 27 with unknown sex). 9 of these individuals were reported to be deceased. A total of 134 HPO terms were used to annotate the cohort. Disease diagnosis: Short stature, optic nerve atrophy, and Pelger-Huet anomaly (OMIM:614800). It was reported that missense or in-frame deletions in the C-terminal region of the NBAS gene are associated with  SOPH syndrome (614800), 
missense or in-frame deletions in the Sec30 domain of NBAS are associated with infantile liver failure syndrome type 2 (616483), 
while missense or in-frame deletions in the beta-propeller domain of NBAS are associated with a combined phenotype of multisystem involvement with acute liver failure \cite{PMID_38244286}.
In our dataset, we found an association with  missense or in-frame deletions in the Sec30 with decreased circulating IgG. A similar finding was obtain for missense variants in general.
Due to the small size of our cohort, this finding should be regarded as preliminary.
 A total of 74 unique variant alleles were found in \textit{NBAS} (transcript: \texttt{NM\_015909.4}, protein id: \texttt{NP\_056993.2}).}
