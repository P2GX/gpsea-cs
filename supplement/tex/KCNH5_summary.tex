\caption{ The cohort comprised 27 individuals (14 females, 13 males). A total of 28 HPO terms were used to annotate the cohort. Disease diagnosis: Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 112 (OMIM:620537). Two recurrent variants have been reported, p.Arg327His and p.Arg333His, both of which are located in or near the functionally critical 
voltage-sensing or pore domains. Happ et al (2023) state that in their cohort, Individuals with the recurrent p.Arg333His variant had a self-limited 
drug-responsive focal or generalized epilepsy and normal intellect, whereas the recurrent p.Arg327His variant was associated with infantile-onset DEE \cite{PMID_36307226}. 
A total of 27 unique variant alleles were found in \textit{KCNH5} (transcript: \texttt{NM\_139318.5}, protein id: \texttt{NP\_647479.2}).}
