\caption{ The cohort comprised 146 individuals (81 females, 65 males). 5 of these individuals were reported to be deceased. 
A total of 200 HPO terms were used to annotate the cohort. Disease diagnoses: Kabuki syndrome 2 (OMIM:300867) (81 individuals), Kabuki Syndrome 1 (OMIM:147920) (65 individuals). 
Previous studies have found that the phenotype of KS2 is different from that of KS1, for example, patients with KS1 type have a higher risk of typical facial features, short stature, 
and frequent infections compared to those with KS2 \cite{PMID_30514738,PMID_23320472,PMID_38373926}.
A total of 105 unique variant alleles were found in \textit{n/a} (transcript: \texttt{n/a}, protein id: \texttt{n/a}).}
