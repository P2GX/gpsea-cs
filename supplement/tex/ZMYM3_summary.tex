\caption{ The cohort comprised 33 individuals (3 females, 30 males). 1 of these individuals were reported to be deceased. A total of 78 HPO terms were used to annotate the cohort. Disease diagnosis: Intellectual developmental disorder, X-linked 112 (OMIM:301111).  A total of 22 unique variant alleles were found in \textit{ZMYM3} (transcript: \texttt{NM\_201599.3}, protein id: \texttt{NP\_963893.1}). No analysis of \textit{ZMYM3} genotype phgenotype correlation was presented in the two studies on \textit{ZMYM3} variants study to be published to date \cite{PMID_24721225,PMID_36586412}.}
