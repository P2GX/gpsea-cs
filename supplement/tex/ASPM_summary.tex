\caption{ The cohort comprised 22 individuals (14 females, 8 males). A total of 17 HPO terms were used to annotate the cohort. Disease diagnosis: Microcephaly 5, primary, autosomal recessive (OMIM:608716). No statistically significant results identified. A total of 15 unique variant alleles were found in \textit{ASPM} (transcript: \texttt{NM\_018136.5}, protein id: \texttt{NP\_060606.3}).}
