\caption{The cohort comprised 32 individuals (12 females, 8 males, 12 with unknown sex). 9 of these individuals were 
reported to be deceased. A total of 110 HPO terms were used to annotate the cohort. Disease diagnoses: 
Coffin-Siris syndrome 3 (OMIM:614608) (18 individuals), Rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome 1 (OMIM:609322) 
(14 individuals). Our analysis of SMARCB1 included variants associated with Coffin-Siris syndrome 3 (OMIM:614608).
A total of 32 unique variant alleles were found in \textit{SMARCB1} (transcript: \texttt{NM\_003073.5}, 
protein id: \texttt{NP\_003064.2}). Presumably the result of embryonal neoplasm being signficantly associated with structural variants relates to a 
different distribution of variants in rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome-1 than in Coffin-Siris syndrome 3.
A published analysis of GPCs in Coffin-Siris syndrome did not present a statistical analysis and did not note the current association \cite{PMID_25168959}.}
