\caption{The cohort comprised 30 individuals (17 females, 13 males). A total of 16 HPO terms were used to annotate the cohort. Disease diagnosis: Albinism, oculocutaneous, type IV (OMIM:606574). No significant association identified. A total of 52 unique variant alleles were found in \textit{SLC45A2} (transcript: \texttt{NM\_016180.5}, protein id: \texttt{NP\_057264.4}).}
