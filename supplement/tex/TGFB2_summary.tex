\caption{ The cohort comprised 36 individuals (10 females, 26 males). 1 of these individuals were reported to be deceased. A total of 68 HPO terms were used to annotate the cohort. Disease diagnosis: Loeys-Dietz syndrome 4 (OMIM:614816). No significant association found. A total of 36 unique variant alleles were found in \textit{TGFB2} (transcript: \texttt{NM\_003238.6}, protein id: \texttt{NP\_003229.1}).}
