\caption{ The cohort comprised 19 individuals (8 females, 11 males). 1 of these individuals were reported to be deceased. A total of 76 HPO terms were used to annotate the cohort. Disease diagnoses: Immunodeficiency, common variable, 15 (OMIM:620670) (11 individuals), Tubulointerstitial kidney disease, autosomal dominant, 5 (OMIM:617056) (7 individuals), Neutropenia, severe congenital, 11, autosomal dominant (OMIM:620674) (1 individuals). The origin of clinical diversity in patients with SEC61A1 mutation is currently unclear. 
With our present patient set, a particular phenotype cannot be predicted on the basis of location or nature of the mutation \cite{PMID_32325141}.
 A total of 6 unique variant alleles were found in \textit{SEC61A1} (transcript: \texttt{NM\_013336.4}, protein id: \texttt{NP\_037468.1}).}
