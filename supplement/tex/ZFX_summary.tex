\caption{ The cohort comprised 19 individuals (4 females, 14 males, 1 with unknown sex). A total of 203 HPO terms were used to annotate the cohort. Disease diagnosis: Intellectual developmental disorder, X-linked syndromic 37 (OMIM:301118). The small cohort size and the fact that the majority of the ZFX variants were private to each proband or 
family made the assessment of genotype-phenotype correlation difficult. A recent report of a
germline ZFX missense variant in a patient With primary hyperparathyroidism suggested the hypothesis of
testing for correlation between missense variants and hyperparathyroidism \cite{PMID_38325380,PMID_39056049}. A total of 11 unique variant alleles were found in \textit{ZFX} (transcript: \texttt{NM\_003410.4}, protein id: \texttt{NP\_003401.2}).}
