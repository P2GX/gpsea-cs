\caption{ The cohort comprised 41 individuals (17 females, 24 males). 3 of these individuals were reported to be deceased. A total of 97 HPO terms were used to annotate the cohort. 
Disease diagnosis: Hypotonia, infantile, with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies 3 (OMIM:616900). 
Durham et al (2023) stated that several studies have touched on a genotype-phenotype correlation of TBCK syndrome; however, more data are required for statistically significant conclusions \cite{PMID_37455236}. 
A total of 48 unique variant alleles were found in \textit{TBCK} (transcript: \texttt{NM\_001163435.3}, protein id: \texttt{NP\_001156907.2}).}
