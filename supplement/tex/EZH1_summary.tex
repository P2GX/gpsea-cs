\caption{The cohort comprised 19 individuals (10 females, 8 males, 1 with unknown sex). A total of 106 HPO terms were used to annotate the cohort. Disease diagnosis: EZH1-related neurodevelopmental disorder (OMIM:601674). No statistically significant results identified. A total of 20 unique variant alleles were found in \textit{EZH1} (transcript: \texttt{NM\_001991.5}, protein id: \texttt{NP\_001982.2}). In the original publication, it is stated that patients show neurodevelopmental delay with variable clinical presentations regardless of variant type and zygosity \cite{PMID_37433783}.}
