\caption{ The cohort comprised 65 individuals (32 females, 33 males). A total of 55 HPO terms were used to annotate the cohort. Disease diagnoses: Loeys-Dietz syndrome 3 (OMIM:613795) (49 individuals), Loeys-Dietz syndrome 6 (OMIM:619656) (16 individuals). . A total of 65 unique variant alleles were found in \textit{n/a} (transcript: \texttt{n/a}, protein id: \texttt{n/a}).}
