\caption{ The cohort comprised 72 individuals (35 females, 35 males, 2 with unknown sex). A total of 98 HPO terms were used to annotate the cohort. Disease diagnoses: Loeys-Dietz syndrome 3 (OMIM:613795) (49 individuals), Loeys-Dietz syndrome 6 (OMIM:619656) (18 individuals), Congenital heart defects, multiple types, 8, with or without heterotaxy (OMIM:619657) (5 individuals). A total of 25 unique variant alleles were found.}
