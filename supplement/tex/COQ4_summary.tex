\caption{The cohort comprised 51 individuals (30 females, 21 males). 19 of these individuals were reported to be deceased.
A total of 91 HPO terms were used to annotate the cohort. 
A previous work found that pathogenic COQ4 variants in exons 1-4
are associated with less life-threating presentations, late onset, responsiveness to CoQ10 therapy,
and a relatively long lifespan, but correction for multiple testing was not performed \cite{PMID_35154243}.
Disease diagnoses: Coenzyme Q10 deficiency, primary, 7 (OMIM:616276) (35 individuals), Spastic ataxia 10, autosomal recessive (OMIM:620666) (16 individuals). A total of 32 unique variant alleles were found in \textit{COQ4} (transcript: \texttt{NM\_016035.5}, protein id: \texttt{NP\_057119.3}).}
