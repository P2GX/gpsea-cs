\caption{The cohort comprised 16 individuals (8 females, 8 males). A total of 85 HPO terms were used to annotate the cohort. 
Disease diagnoses: Acromelic frontonasal dysostosis (OMIM:603671) (9 individuals), 
Neurodevelopmental disorder with movement abnormalities, abnormal gait, and autistic features (OMIM:617865) (7 individuals). 
No statistically significant results identified. A total of 2 unique variant alleles were found in \textit{ZSWIM6} 
(transcript: \texttt{NM\_020928.2}, protein id: \texttt{NP\_001685.1}).}
