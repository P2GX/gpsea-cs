\caption{ The cohort comprised 49 individuals (22 females, 27 males). 
A total of 30 HPO terms were used to annotate the cohort. Disease diagnosis: Loeys-Dietz syndrome 3 
(OMIM:613795). There was no evidence of a correlation between missense variants and specific 
phenotypic abnormalities. In contrast, there was a statistically significant correlation with 
Arg287Trp and Osteoarthritis. The residue Arg287 is located in the Mad homology 2 (MH2) domain in a 
region that mediates interaction with exportin 4 \cite{PMID_16449645}. Chesneau et al stated that there is an absence of correlation between the SMAD3 variant type and the occurrence of aortic phenotypes \cite{PMID_32154675}.
To the best of our knowledge an association between Arg287Trp and Osteoarthritis has not been previously noted.
A total of 49 unique variant alleles were found in \textit{SMAD3} (transcript: \texttt{NM\_005902.4}, protein id: \texttt{NP\_005893.1}).}
