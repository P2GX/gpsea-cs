\caption{ The cohort comprised 37 individuals (10 females, 23 males, 4 with unknown sex). 24 of these individuals were reported to be deceased. 
A total of 107 HPO terms were used to annotate the cohort. Disease diagnoses: Mitochondrial complex IV deficiency, nuclear type 2 (OMIM:604377) (31 individuals), 
Myopia 6 (OMIM:608908) (6 individuals). The glu140lys correlation is driven by 5 patients found to be homozygous for the Glu140Lys variant \cite{PMID_15499950}. 
The children were between the age of 8 months and 1 year and 8 months. Because of the relatively small cohort and the fact that other members of the cohort were not as young, caution is advised in the interpretation of this finding.  A total of 25 unique variant alleles were found in \textit{SCO2} (transcript: \texttt{NM\_005138.3}, protein id: \texttt{NP\_005129.2}).}
