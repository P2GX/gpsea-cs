\caption{ The cohort comprised 94 individuals (30 females, 46 males, 18 with unknown sex). 6 of these individuals were reported to be deceased. A total of 110 HPO terms were used to annotate the cohort. Disease diagnoses: Loeys-Dietz syndrome 2 (OMIM:610168) (53 individuals), Loeys-Dietz syndrome 1 (OMIM:609192) (23 individuals), Multiple self-healing squamous epithelioma, susceptibility to (OMIM:132800) (18 individuals). . A total of 94 unique variant alleles were found in \textit{n/a} (transcript: \texttt{n/a}, protein id: \texttt{n/a}).}
