\caption{ The cohort comprised 61 individuals (28 females, 33 males). A total of 209 HPO terms were used to annotate the cohort. Disease diagnosis: ReNU syndrome (OMIM:620851). No previous statistical analysis of correlations with PTPN11 missense variants identified in the medical literature. A total of 7 unique variant alleles were found in \textit{RNU4-2} (transcript: \texttt{NR\_003137.3}, protein id: \texttt{}).}
